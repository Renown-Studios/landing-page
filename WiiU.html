<h1 style="Font-family: Calibri">How to mod your Wii U</h1>
<h3 style="Font-family: Calibri">There are certain requirements and things you need to know before attempting to mod your Wii U</h3>
<ol>
   <li style="Font-family: Calibri"> CFW stands for custom firmware which is a modified version of the original system firmware to grant you full access over your console, think of it like Administrator on your computer
  <li style="Font-family: Calibri"> Homebrew and CFW can allow you to: play ROM hacks (modified games), emulators on your console and even ebook reading if you want! Homebrew allows you to do quite a lot.
  <li style="Font-family: Calibri">Homebrew Installation is SEMI-PERMANENT, only a HARDWARE and some software modifications can remove CFW</li>
  <li style="Font-family: Calibri">If you have installed CFW before via Mocha (Indexiine), go to wiiu.hacks.guide to find out how to uninstall Indexiine, for CBHC users, please follow the guide on uninstalling CBHC on wiiu.hacks.guide and for Haxchi users, uninstall the app via Data Management in System Settings
  <li style="Font-family: Calibri">There is always a chance you can BRICK your console, some bricks require some hardware tampering to remove but not ALL, make sure you follow each step precisely. (don't worry though, most bricks are ultra-rare)
  <li style="Font-family: Calibri"> The version this exploit runs on is 5.5.5 Europe and everywhere else and 5.5.6 for North America
  <li style="Font-family: Calibri">This exploit requires and SD card at or above 32 gigabytes of capacity, internet access on both your console and your computer and a computer which can read and write files to your SD card (you can also use a microsd card with an adapter, which is what I use)
</ol>
<h2 style="Font-family: Calibri">Method to modding a Wii U</h2>
<ol>
  <li style="Font-family: Calibri">Put your SD card into your computer to prepare the files required to mod your Wii U  </li>
  <li style="Font-family: Calibri">Start by downloading the files for Aroma CFW and Payload Installer and placing them on your SD card. </li>
  <li style="Font-family: Calibri">Then place the SD card into your Wii U </li>
  <li style="Font-family: Calibri"> Launch your console, then navigate to the web browser. Type in wiiuexploit.xyz, and it will take you to a webpage which wil have a button saying 'Run Exploit'. Click this and hold 'X. Select the box Tiramisu-A to set your main bootloader to Aroma.</li>
  <li style="Font-family: Calibri">Press B then select 'Install PayLoader', the screen should be black with a blinking white underscore, then should say 'PayLoader installed successfully. Press B to exit.' Press B.</li>
  <li style="Font-family: Calibri">Then, select 'Dump NAND backup'. Press A. Note: This may take a while as it is taking an entire image of your Wii U and uploading it to your SD Card. Once it is completed, press B</li>
  <li style="Font-family: Calibri">Turn off your console and remove the SD card. Place it in your computer. Go to 'wiiubak' and move all the files to your computer or a storage device. Your Wii U is successfully modded!</li>
