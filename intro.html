Who are we?
we are a team of passionate gamers looking to create our own masterpieces in the future as well as a few treats for other games
- what tools do we use?
our code is all here on github or on our subsidiary (for minecraft specific things) NotRedacted
our file-sharing system is google drive. we heavily recommend this to others as it is simple, easy to use and allows for simple collaboration
our communications platform is on discord
our coding software is visual studio (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/en/)
- why do we share what tools we use
we don't want to gatekeep info :)
- will all of our projects be open-source
We know that people are weary of what they use, so our projects will mostly be open-source, specifically our modifications. HOWEVER, our games, coming in the future, will NOT be open-source.
